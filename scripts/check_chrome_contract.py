"""test_chrome_contract.py -- shared chrome regressions that are invisible in a build.

Every check here corresponds to a bug that shipped to the live sites and produced
no build error, no Liquid exception and no failing build output. All four sites
share the chrome, so all four regressed together and all four are covered here.

Two ways to run it:

    # whole workspace, all four sites at once
    python test_chrome_contract.py

    # a single site -- this is what CI runs, because a per-site checkout has no
    # siblings to compare against. Accepts a site directory, a workspace root
    # containing the site, or nothing (defaults to the layout around this file).
    python test_chrome_contract.py --site /path/to/neohiro.github.io

Single-site mode still catches every bug this file was written for: they are all
"this site's own copy of a shared file is wrong", which is exactly the failure
mode when four hand-copied copies drift apart. What it cannot do is compare the
copies against each other, so the cross-site diff is a separate check
(--diff) that only the workspace run can perform.

Exit code 0 = pass, 1 = at least one failure.

# parsed out of the layout, not from every .css file in the repo.
