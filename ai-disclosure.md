  Buttons below are gated on the target page existing in THIS site. The
  disclosure ships to all four network sites but they publish different page
  sets, so a hard-coded link to /repositories/ or /contact/ is a dead link on
  every site except the one that has those pages.

This page had no <h1> at all: it opened straight into <h2>What the seal means</h2>.
A document with no top-level heading is a real accessibility and SEO defect — the
reader has no programmatic page title to navigate by, and crawlers have nothing
to treat as the page heading. The layout's <title> is not a substitute: it is
document metadata, not document structure. Restored here, matching the pattern
the other pages in this site use.

      <p>
        The <b>AI&#8209;assisted</b> mark in the corner of every page is an
        honesty notice, not a badge. It says that AI tooling was involved in
        producing or editing text on this site &mdash; drafting, rewriting,
        tightening prose, generating code, or checking it.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is on every page rather than buried on this one because a disclosure
        you have to go looking for is not a disclosure. If a page here was
        written without assistance, the mark still appears; the mark describes
        the site, not the individual article.

      <p>
        The seal is not a quality rating, an accuracy guarantee, or a
        substitute for reading the thing. Concretely:
      </p>
      <dl class="host-dl">
        <div class="host-dl-row">
          <dt>Not verified by definition</dt>
          <dd>
            AI output is fluent and frequently wrong. Anything technical on
            this site should be treated as a draft until you have tried it.
          </dd>
        </div>
        <div class="host-dl-row">
          <dt>Not a substitute for sources</dt>
          <dd>
            Where a claim matters, the underlying source is linked. Follow the
            link rather than trusting the summary above it.
          </dd>
        </div>

            Nothing here is generated to push you anywhere. There is no
            telemetry, no tracking pixel and no advertising on this site.

        This is the part that matters. Every claim above is checkable without
        taking anyone's word for it:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>The hardening guides cite control references.</b> STIG and CIS
          identifiers are given so a claim can be checked against the published
          control rather than against this page's interpretation of it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>The code is public.</b> Everything described here lives in public
          repositories under
          <a href="https://github.com/neohiro" target="_blank" rel="noopener">github.com/neohiro</a>,
          with public history. Read it, fork it, or run it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>The corrections are public too.</b> An error that has been fixed
          leaves a trace in the history. If something here is wrong, the fix is
          a pull request, not a quiet edit.

        If a page states something false &mdash; a broken mitigation, an
        invented control reference, a security claim that does not hold
        &mdash; that is a bug and it is worth reporting. Security findings go
        through the private advisory channel described in
        <code>SECURITY.md</code>; everything else is an issue on the relevant
        repository.
